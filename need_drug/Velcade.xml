                        <paragraph>VELCADE (1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) is administered intravenously in combination with intravenous rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and oral prednisone (VcR-CAP) for six 3-week treatment cycles as shown in Table 3.  VELCADE is administered first followed by rituximab.  VELCADE is administered twice weekly for two weeks (Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) followed by a 10-day rest period on Days 12-21. For patients with a response first documented at cycle 6, two additional VcR-CAP cycles are recommended. At least 72 hours should elapse between consecutive doses of VELCADE.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>VELCADE treatment causes a peripheral neuropathy that is predominantly sensory; however, cases of severe sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy have been reported. Patients with pre-existing symptoms (numbness, pain or a burning feeling in the feet or hands) and/or signs of peripheral neuropathy may experience worsening peripheral neuropathy (including â¥ Grade 3) during treatment with VELCADE. Patients should be monitored for symptoms of neuropathy, such as a burning sensation, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, neuropathic pain or weakness. In the Phase 3 relapsed multiple myeloma trial comparing VELCADE subcutaneous versus intravenous the incidence of Grade â¥ 2 peripheral neuropathy was 24% for subcutaneous and 39% for intravenous. Grade â¥ 3 peripheral neuropathy occurred in 6% of patients in the subcutaneous treatment group, compared with 15% in the intravenous treatment group. Starting VELCADE subcutaneously may be considered for patients with pre-existing or at high risk of peripheral neuropathy.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES; formerly termed Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS)) has occurred in patients receiving VELCADE. PRES is a rare, reversible, neurological disorder which can present with seizure, hypertension, headache, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual and neurological disturbances. Brain imaging, preferably MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), is used to confirm the diagnosis. In patients developing PRES, discontinue VELCADE. The safety of reinitiating VELCADE therapy in patients previously experiencing PRES is not known.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>VELCADE is associated with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia that follow a cyclical pattern with nadirs occurring following the last dose of each cycle and typically recovering prior to initiation of the subsequent cycle.  The cyclical pattern of platelet and neutrophil decreases and recovery remain consistent in the studies of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma, with no evidence of cumulative thrombocytopenia or neutropenia in the treatment regimens studied.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Monitor complete blood counts (CBC) frequently during treatment with VELCADE.  Measure platelet counts prior to each dose of VELCADE.

                              <paragraph>The safety data described below and in Table 10 reflect exposure to either VELCADE (n=331) or dexamethasone (n=332) in a study of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma. VELCADE was administered intravenously at doses of 1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> twice weekly for 2 out of 3 weeks (21-day cycle). After eight 21-day cycles patients continued therapy for three 35-day cycles on a weekly schedule. Duration of treatment was up to 11 cycles (9 months) with a median duration of 6 cycles (4.1 months). For inclusion in the trial, patients must have had measurable disease and 1 to 3 prior therapies. There was no upper age limit for entry. Creatinine clearance could be as low as 20 mL/min and bilirubin levels as high as 1.5 times the upper limit of normal. The overall frequency of adverse reactions was similar in men and women, and in patients &lt; 65 and â¥ 65 years of age. Most patients were Caucasian [<content styleCode="italics">see<linkHtml href="#S14.1"> Clinical Studies (14.1)</linkHtml>
                                 </content>].</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Among the 331 VELCADE-treated patients, the most commonly reported (&gt; 20%) adverse reactions overall were nausea (52%), diarrhea (52%), fatigue (39%), peripheral neuropathies (35%), thrombocytopenia (33%), constipation (30%), vomiting (29%), and anorexia (21%). The most commonly reported (&gt; 20%) adverse reaction reported among the 332 patients in the dexamethasone group was fatigue (25%).  Eight percent (8%) of patients in the VELCADE-treated arm experienced a Grade 4 adverse reaction; the most common reactions were thrombocytopenia (4%) and neutropenia (2%). Nine percent (9%) of dexamethasone-treated patients experienced a Grade 4 adverse reaction. All individual dexamethasone-related Grade 4 adverse reactions were less than 1%.</paragraph>

A total of 80 (24%) patients from the VELCADE treatment arm experienced a serious adverse reaction during the study, as did 83 (25%) dexamethasone-treated patients. The most commonly reported serious adverse reactions in the VELCADE treatment arm were diarrhea (3%), dehydration, herpes zoster, pyrexia, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, and thrombocytopenia (2% each). In the dexamethasone treatment group, the most commonly reported serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (4%), hyperglycemia (3%), pyrexia, and psychotic disorder (2% each).</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>A total of 145 patients, including 84 (25%) of 331 patients in the VELCADE treatment group and 61 (18%) of 332 patients in the dexamethasone treatment group were discontinued from treatment due to adverse reactions. Among the 331 VELCADE treated patients, the most commonly reported adverse reaction leading to discontinuation was peripheral neuropathy (8%). Among the 332 patients in the dexamethasone group, the most commonly reported adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation were psychotic disorder and hyperglycemia (2% each).</paragraph>
                                    <paragraph>Four deaths were considered to be VELCADE-related in this relapsed multiple myeloma study: 1 case each of cardiogenic shock, respiratory insufficiency, congestive heart failure and cardiac arrest. Four deaths were considered dexamethasone-related:  2 cases of sepsis, 1 case of bacterial meningitis, and 1 case of sudden death at home.</paragraph>

Only 2 (1%) patients were reported as having severe reactions, 1 case of pruritus and 1 case of redness. Local reactions led to reduction in injection concentration in one patient and drug discontinuation in one patient. Local reactions resolved in a median of 6 days.</paragraph>

This analysis does not include data from the Phase 3 Open-Label Study of VELCADE subcutaneous versus intravenous in relapsed multiple myeloma. In the integrated studies, the safety profile of VELCADE was similar in patients with multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In the integrated analysis, the most commonly reported (&gt; 20%) adverse reactions were nausea (49%), diarrhea (46%), asthenic conditions including fatigue (41%) and weakness (11%), peripheral neuropathies (38%), thrombocytopenia (32%), vomiting (28%), constipation (25%), and pyrexia (21%). Eleven percent (11%) of patients experienced at least 1 episode of â¥ Grade 4 toxicity, most commonly thrombocytopenia (4%) and neutropenia (2%).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In the Phase 2 relapsed multiple myeloma clinical trials of VELCADE administered intravenously, local skin irritation was reported in 5% of patients, but extravasation of VELCADE was not associated with tissue damage.</paragraph>

The most common adverse drug reaction was thrombocytopenia which occurred in 52% of the patients.  The incidence of â¥ Grade 3 thrombocytopenia was 24%.  Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 28% of patients, with the incidence of â¥ Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy reported at 6%. The incidence of serious adverse reactions was 12.3%. The most commonly reported serious adverse reactions were thrombocytopenia (3.8%),  diarrhea (2.3%), and herpes zoster and pneumonia (1.5% each).  </paragraph>

                        <paragraph>The effectiveness of VELCADE in pediatric patients with relapsed pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has not been established.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The activity and safety of VELCADE in combination with intensive reinduction chemotherapy was evaluated in pediatric and young adult patients with lymphoid malignancies (pre-B cell ALL 77%, 16% with T-cell ALL, and 7% T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL)), all of whom  relapsed within 36 months of initial diagnosis in a single-arm multicenter, non-randomized cooperative group trial.  An effective reinduction multiagent chemotherapy regimen was administered in 3 blocks. Block 1 included vincristine, prednisone, doxorubicin and pegaspargase; block 2 included cyclophosphamide, etoposide and methotrexate; block 3 included high dose cytosine arabinoside and asparaginase.  VELCADE was administered at a dose of 1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> as a bolus intravenous injection on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of block 1 and days 1, 4, and 8 of block 2.  There were 140 patients with ALL or LL enrolled and evaluated for safety.  The median age was 10 years (range 1 to 26), 57% were male, 70% were white, 14% were black, 4% were Asian, 2% were American Indian/ Alaska Native, 1% were Pacific Islander.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The activity was evaluated in a pre-specified subset of the first 60 evaluable patients enrolled on the study with pre-B ALL â¤ 21 years and relapsed &lt; 36 months from diagnosis.  The complete remission (CR) rate at day 36 was compared to that in a historical control set of patients who had received the identical backbone therapy without VELCADE.  There was no evidence that the addition of VELCADE had any impact on the CR rate.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>No new safety concerns were observed when VELCADE was added to a chemotherapy backbone regimen as compared with a historical control group in which the backbone regimen was given without VELCADE.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>The BSA-normalized clearance of bortezomib in pediatric patients was similar to that observed in adults.</paragraph>

In humans, fatal outcomes following the administration of more than twice the recommended therapeutic dose have been reported, which were associated with the acute onset of symptomatic hypotension (5.2) and thrombocytopenia (5.7). In the event of an overdosage, the patient's vital signs should be monitored and appropriate supportive care given.</paragraph>
                  <paragraph>Studies in monkeys and dogs showed that intravenous bortezomib doses as low as 2 times the recommended clinical dose on a mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis were associated with increases in heart rate, decreases in contractility, hypotension, and death. In dog studies, a slight increase in the corrected QT interval was observed at doses resulting in death. In monkeys, doses of 3.0 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and greater (approximately twice the recommended clinical dose) resulted in hypotension starting at 1 hour post-administration, with progression to death in 12 to 14 hours following drug administration.</paragraph>

                     <text>
                        <paragraph>Bortezomib is a reversible inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the 26S proteasome in mammalian cells. The 26S proteasome is a large protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays an essential role in regulating the intracellular concentration of specific proteins, thereby maintaining homeostasis within cells. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted proteolysis, which can affect multiple signaling cascades within the cell. This disruption of normal homeostatic mechanisms can lead to cell death. Experiments have demonstrated that bortezomib is cytotoxic to a variety of cancer cell types <content styleCode="italics">in vitro</content>. Bortezomib causes a delay in tumor growth <content styleCode="italics">in vivo</content> in nonclinical tumor models, including multiple myeloma.</paragraph>

                        <paragraph>Following intravenous administration of 1 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and 1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> doses to 24 patients with multiple myeloma (n=12, per each dose level), the mean maximum plasma concentrations of bortezomib (C<sub>max</sub>) after the first dose (Day 1) were 57 and 112 ng/mL, respectively. In subsequent doses, when administered twice weekly, the mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 106 ng/mL for the 1 mg/m<sup>2</sup> dose and 89 to 120 ng/mL for the 1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> dose. The mean elimination half-life of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40 to 193 hours after the 1 mg/m<sup>2</sup> dose and 76 to 108 hours after the 1.3mg/m<sup>2</sup> dose. The mean total body clearances was 102 and 112 L/h following the first dose for doses of 1 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and 1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h following subsequent doses for doses of 1 and 1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively.</paragraph>
                        <paragraph>Following an intravenous bolus or subcutaneous injection of a 1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> dose to patients (n = 14 for intravenous, n = 17 for subcutaneous) with multiple myeloma, the total systemic exposure after repeat dose administration (AUC<sub>last</sub>) was equivalent for subcutaneous and intravenous administration. The C<sub>max</sub> after subcutaneous administration (20.4 ng/mL) was lower than intravenous (223 ng/mL). The AUC<sub>last</sub> geometric mean ratio was 0.99 and 90% confidence intervals were 80.18% - 122.80%.</paragraph>

                                 <content styleCode="bold italics">:</content> The mean distribution volume of bortezomib ranged from approximately 498 to 1884 L/m<sup>2</sup> following single- or repeat-dose administration of 1 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or 1.3mg/m<sup>2</sup> to patients with multiple myeloma. This suggests bortezomib distributes widely to peripheral tissues. The binding of bortezomib to human plasma proteins averaged 83% over the concentration range of 100 to 1000 ng/mL.</paragraph>

                                 <content styleCode="italics"> In vitro</content> studies with human liver microsomes and human cDNA-expressed cytochrome P450 isozymes indicate that bortezomib is primarily oxidatively metabolized via cytochrome P450 enzymes 3A4, 2C19, and 1A2. Bortezomib metabolism by CYP 2D6 and 2C9 enzymes is minor. The major metabolic pathway is deboronation to form 2 deboronated metabolites that subsequently undergo hydroxylation to several metabolites. Deboronated bortezomib metabolites are inactive as 26S proteasome inhibitors. Pooled plasma data from 8 patients at 10 min and 30 min after dosing indicate that the plasma levels of metabolites are low compared to the parent drug.</paragraph>

Neurotoxic effects of bortezomib in animal studies included axonal swelling and degeneration in peripheral nerves, dorsal spinal roots, and tracts of the spinal cord. Additionally, multifocal hemorrhage and necrosis in the brain, eye, and heart were observed.</paragraph>

                              </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>A prospective, international, randomized (1:1), open-label clinical study of 682 patients was conducted to determine whether VELCADE administered intravenously (1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) in combination with melphalan (9 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and prednisone (60 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) resulted in improvement in time to progression (TTP) when compared to melphalan (9 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and prednisone (60 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) in patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma. Treatment was administered for a maximum of 9 cycles (approximately 54 weeks) and was discontinued early for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Antiviral prophylaxis was recommended for patients on the VELCADE study arm.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The median age of the patients in the study was 71 years (48;91), 50% were male, 88% were Caucasian and the median Karnofsky performance status score for the patients was 80 (60;100). Patients had IgG/IgA/Light chain myeloma in 63%/25%/8% instances, a median hemoglobin of 105 g/L (64;165), and a median platelet count of 221,500 /microliter (33,000;587,000).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Efficacy results for the trial are presented in Table 14. At a pre-specified interim analysis (with median follow-up of 16.3 months), the combination of VELCADE, melphalan and prednisone therapy resulted in significantly superior results for time to progression, progression-free survival, overall survival and response rate. Further enrollment was halted, and patients receiving melphalan and prednisone were offered VELCADE in addition. A later, pre-specified analysis of overall survival (with median follow-up of 36.7 months with a hazard ratio of 0.65, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.84) resulted in a statistically significant survival benefit for the VELCADE, melphalan and prednisone treatment arm despite subsequent therapies including VELCADE based regimens. In an updated analysis of overall survival based on 387 deaths (median follow-up 60.1 months), the median overall survival for the VELCADE, melphalan and prednisone treatment arm was 56.4 months and for the melphalan and prednisone treatment arm was 43.1 months, with a hazard ratio of 0.695 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.85).</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>A prospective phase 3, international, randomized (1:1), stratified, open-label clinical study enrolling 669 patients was designed to determine whether VELCADE resulted in improvement in time to progression (TTP) compared to high-dose dexamethasone in patients with progressive multiple myeloma following 1 to 3 prior therapies. Patients considered to be refractory to prior high-dose dexamethasone were excluded as were those with baseline Grade â¥ 2 peripheral neuropathy or platelet counts &lt; 50,000/ÂµL. A total of 627 patients were evaluable for response.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Stratification factors were based on the number of lines of prior therapy the patient had previously received (1 previous line versus more than 1 line of therapy), time of progression relative to prior treatment (progression during or within 6 months of stopping their most recent therapy versus relapse &gt; 6 months after receiving their most recent therapy), and screening Î²<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin levels (â¤ 2.5 mg/L versus &gt; 2.5 mg/L).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Baseline patient and disease characteristics are summarized in Table 15.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Patients in the VELCADE treatment group were to receive eight 3-week treatment cycles followed by three 5-week treatment cycles of VELCADE. Patients achieving a CR were treated for 4 cycles beyond first evidence of CR. Within each 3-week treatment cycle, VELCADE 1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/dose alone was administered by intravenous bolus twice weekly for 2 weeks on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 followed by a 10-day rest period (Days 12 to 21). Within each 5-week treatment cycle, VELCADE 1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/dose alone was administered by intravenous bolus once weekly for 4 weeks on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 followed by a 13-day rest period (Days 23 to 35) [<content styleCode="italics">see<linkHtml href="#S2.2"> Dosage and Administration (2.2)</linkHtml>

                              <paragraph>Patients in the dexamethasone treatment group were to receive four 5-week treatment cycles followed by five 4-week treatment cycles. Within each 5-week treatment cycle, dexamethasone 40 mg/day PO was administered once daily on Days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 followed by a 15-day rest period (Days 21-35). Within each 4-week treatment cycle, dexamethasone 40 mg/day PO was administered once daily on Days 1 to 4 followed by a 24-day rest period (Days 5 to 28). Patients with documented progressive disease on dexamethasone were offered VELCADE at a standard dose and schedule on a companion study. Following a preplanned interim analysis of time to progression, the dexamethasone arm was halted and all patients randomized to dexamethasone were offered VELCADE, regardless of disease status.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>In the VELCADE arm, 34% of patients received at least one VELCADE dose in all 8 of the 3-week cycles of therapy, and 13% received at least one dose in all 11 cycles. The average number of VELCADE doses during the study was 22, with a range of 1 to 44. In the dexamethasone arm, 40% of patients received at least one dose in all 4 of the 5-week treatment cycles of therapy, and 6% received at least one dose in all 9 cycles.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The time to event analyses and response rates from the relapsed multiple myeloma study are presented in Table 16. Response and progression were assessed using the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria. Complete response (CR) required &lt; 5% plasma cells in the marrow, 100% reduction in M-protein, and a negative immunofixation test (IF<sup>-</sup>). Partial response (PR) requires â¥ 50% reduction in serum myeloma protein and â¥ 90% reduction of urine myeloma protein on at least 2 occasions for a minimum of at least 6 weeks along with stable bone disease and normal calcium. Near complete response (nCR) was defined as meeting all the criteria for complete response including 100% reduction in M-protein by protein electrophoresis; however, M-protein was still detectable by immunofixation (IF<sup>+</sup>).</paragraph>

                              </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>An open-label, randomized, phase 3 non-inferiority study compared the efficacy and safety of the subcutaneous administration of VELCADE versus the intravenous administration. This study included 222 bortezomib naÃ¯ve patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, who were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of VELCADE by either the subcutaneous (n=148) or intravenous (n=74) route for 8 cycles. Patients who did not obtain an optimal response (less than Complete Response (CR)) to therapy with VELCADE alone after 4 cycles were allowed to receive oral dexamethasone 20 mg daily on the day of and after VELCADE administration (82 patients in subcutaneous treatment group and 39 patients in the intravenous treatment group). Patients with baseline Grade â¥ 2 peripheral neuropathy or neuropathic pain, or platelet counts &lt; 50,000/ÂµL were excluded. A total of 218 patients were evaluable for response.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Stratification factors were based on the number of lines of prior therapy the patient had received (1 previous line versus more than 1 line of therapy), and international staging system (ISS) stage (incorporating beta<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin and albumin levels; Stages I, II, or III).</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The baseline demographic and others characteristics of the two treatment groups are summarized as follows: the median age of the patient population was approximately 64 years of age (range 38-88 years), primarily male (subcutaneous: 50%, intravenous: 64%); the primary type of myeloma is IgG (subcutaneous: 65% IgG, 26% IgA, 8% light chain; intravenous: 72% IgG, 19% IgA, 8% light chain), ISS staging I/II/III (%) was 27, 41, 32 for both subcutaneous and intravenous, Karnofsky performance status score was â¤ 70% in 22% of subcutaneous and 16% of intravenous, creatinine clearance was 67.5 mL/min in subcutaneous and 73 mL/min in intravenous, the median years from diagnosis was 2.68 and 2.93 in subcutaneous and intravenous respectively and the proportion of patients with more than one prior line of therapy was 38% in subcutaneous and 35% in intravenous.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>This study met its primary (non-inferiority) objective that single agent subcutaneous VELCADE retains at least 60% of the overall response rate after 4 cycles relative to single agent intravenous VELCADE. The results are provided in Table 17.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>An open-label, multicenter study randomized 54 patients with multiple myeloma who had progressed or relapsed on or after front-line therapy to receive VELCADE 1 mg/m<sup>2</sup> or 1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> intravenous bolus twice weekly for 2 weeks on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 followed by a 10-day rest period (Days 12 to 21). The median duration of time between diagnosis of multiple myeloma and first dose of VELCADE on this trial was 2.0 years, and patients had received a median of 1 prior line of treatment (median of 3 prior therapies). A single complete response was seen at each dose. The overall response rates (CR + PR) were 30% (8/27) at 1 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and 38% (10/26) at 1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup>.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>Patients from the two phase 2 studies, who in the investigators' opinion would experience additional clinical benefit, continued to receive VELCADE beyond 8 cycles on an extension study. Sixty-three (63) patients from the phase 2 multiple myeloma studies were enrolled and received a median of 7 additional cycles of VELCADE therapy for a total median of 14 cycles (range 7 to 32). The overall median dosing intensity was the same in both the parent protocol and extension study. Sixty-seven percent (67%) of patients initiated the extension study at the same or higher dose intensity at which they completed the parent protocol, and 89% of patients maintained the standard 3-week dosing schedule during the extension study. No new cumulative or new long-term toxicities were observed with prolonged VELCADE treatment [<content styleCode="italics">see<linkHtml href="#S6.1"> Adverse Reactions (6.1)</linkHtml>

                              <paragraph>A single arm, open-label trial was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of retreatment with VELCADE.  One hundred and thirty patients (â¥ 18 years of age) with multiple myeloma who previously had at least partial response on a VELCADE-containing regimen (median of 2 prior lines of therapy [range 1-7]) were retreated upon progression with VELCADE administered intravenously. Patients were excluded from trial participation if they had peripheral neuropathy or neuropathic pain of Grade â¥2. At least 6 months after prior VELCADE therapy, VELCADE was restarted at the last tolerated dose of 1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (n=93) or â¤ 1.0 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (n=37) and given on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 every 3 weeks for maximum of 8 cycles either as single agent or in combination with dexamethasone in accordance with the standard of care. Dexamethasone was administered in combination with VELCADE to 83 patients in Cycle 1 with an additional 11 patients receiving dexamethasone during the course of VELCADE retreatment cycles.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The primary endpoint was best confirmed response to retreatment as assessed by European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) criteria.  Fifty of the 130 patients achieved a best confirmed response of Partial Response or better for an overall response rate of 38.5% (95% CI: 30.1, 47.4).  One patient achieved a Complete Response and 49 achieved Partial Response. In the 50 responding patients, the median duration of response was 6.5 months and the range was 0.6 to 19.3 months.</paragraph>

                              <paragraph>A randomized, open-label, Phase 3 study was conducted in 487 adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma (Stage II, III or IV) who were ineligible or not considered for bone marrow transplantation to determine whether VELCADE administered in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (VcR-CAP) resulted in improvement in progression free survival (PFS) when compared to the combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP).  This clinical study utilized independent pathology confirmation and independent radiologic response assessment.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Patients in the VcR-CAP treatment arm received VELCADE (1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) administered intravenously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 (rest period days 12-21); rituximab (375 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on Day 1; cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on Day 1; doxorubicin (50 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on Day 1; and prednisone (100 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on Day 1 through Day 5 of  the 21-day treatment cycle.  For patients with a response first documented at cycle 6, two additional treatment cycles were allowed.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Median patient age was 66 years, 74% were male, 66% were Caucasian and 32% were Asian.  69% of patients had a positive bone marrow aspirate and/or a positive bone marrow biopsy for MCL, 54% of patients had an International Prognostic Index (IPI) score of 3 (high-intermediate) or higher and 76% had Stage IV disease. </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The majority of the patients in both groups received 6 or more cycles of treatment, 84% in the VcR-CAP group and 83% in the R-CHOP group.  Median number of cycles received by patients in both treatment arms was 6 with 17% of patients in the R-CHOP group and 14% of subjects in the VcR-CAP group receiving up to 2 additional cycles.</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The efficacy results of the study with a median follow-up of 40 months are presented in Table 18. The response criteria used to assess efficacy were based on the International Workshop to Standardize Response Criteria for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (IWRC). The combination of VcR-CAP resulted in statistically significant prolongation of PFS compared with R-CHOP (see <linkHtml href="#table18">Table 18</linkHtml> and <linkHtml href="#figure5">Figure 5</linkHtml>). </paragraph>

                              </paragraph>
                              <paragraph>The safety and efficacy of VELCADE in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma were evaluated in an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study of 155 patients with progressive disease who had received at least 1 prior therapy. The median age of the patients was 65 years (42, 89), 81% were male, and 92% were Caucasian. Of the total, 75% had one or more extra-nodal sites of disease, and 77% were stage 4. In 91% of the patients, prior therapy included all of the following: an anthracycline or mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. A total of thirty seven percent (37%) of patients were refractory to their last prior therapy. An intravenous bolus injection of VELCADE 1.3 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/dose was administered twice weekly for 2 weeks on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 followed by a 10-day rest period (Days 12 to 21) for a maximum of 17 treatment cycles. Patients achieving a CR or CRu were treated for 4 cycles beyond first evidence of CR or CRu. The study employed dose modifications for toxicity [<content styleCode="italics">see<linkHtml href="#S2.6"> Dosage and Administration (2.6</linkHtml>,<linkHtml href="#S2.7"> 2.7)</linkHtml>
                                 </content>].</paragraph>
                              <paragraph>Responses to VELCADE are shown in Table 19. Response rates to VELCADE were determined according to the International Workshop Response Criteria (IWRC) based on independent radiologic review of CT scans. The median number of cycles administered across all patients was 4; in responding patients the median number of cycles was 8. The median time to response was 40 days (range 31 to 204 days). The median duration of follow-up was more than 13 months.</paragraph>
